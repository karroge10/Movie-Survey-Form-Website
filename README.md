# Movie Survey Form Website

Movie Survey Form is a website that lets you fill out a form about your movie preferences.

This is my second project in the Responsive Web Design course at FreeCodeCamp.

## Details

The website utilizes features like input fields for text, email, number (in a certain range), radio buttons, checkboxes, submit buttons.

It is also responsive on mobile devices thanks to media queries.
